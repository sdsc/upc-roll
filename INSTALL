This roll bundles the UPC parallel C compiler.  To install, execute these
instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting in
this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll upc
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll upc | bash

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs upc environment module
files in /opt/modulefiles/compilers/upc.

This roll source supports building with different compilers and for different
network fabrics and mpi flavors.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers
for openmpi ethernet.  To build for a different configuration, use the
ROLLCOMPILER, ROLLMPI and ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.,

% make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLMPI=mpich2 ROLLNETWORK=mx 

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "gnu", "intel",
and "pgi" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It supports
ROLLMPI values "openmpi", "mpich2", and "mvapich2", defaulting to "openmpi".
It uses any ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate mpi modules,
assuming that there are modules named $(ROLLMPI)_$(ROLLNETWORK) available
(e.g., openmpi_ib, mpich2_mx, etc.).
